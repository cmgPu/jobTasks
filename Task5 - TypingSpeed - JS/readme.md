# Typing speed

## Description
In the file index.html there is a HTML form.
The client requested us to track the typing speed of the user submitting the form.
We do not know why the client want to track this, but we know it should be tracked only for the field #comment and the speed should be displayed in #speed.
Try to figure out the most reliable way of the users type speed.
If it gets too complicated for you to code it, please be free to explain how you would do it with words.

Note: Lack of information is intentional. It is up to you to find the solution.


## Definition of done
* We don't have to install anything
* The #speed element displays an estimate of user typing speed in characters/minute or words/minute

## You will fail
* if you use anything else apart what is in the index.html file (nothing more than Bootstrap)
